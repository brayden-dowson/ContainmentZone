## Event Details
### A Strange Alliance
Humans Vs SCPs. All human teams are allied to defeat the SCPs. SCPs gain a speed boost equivilant to a cola, +1000 health and +1000 sheild (at 20% health).
> requires [Harmony.dll](https://github.com/brayden-dowson/TheRiptide/releases) as a dependency 

### Bring  Your Kid To Work
Humans have a 50% chance to spawn as a child. Children gain a speed boost equivilant to a cola but have 75 max hp.
> requires [Harmony.dll](https://github.com/brayden-dowson/TheRiptide/releases) as a dependency 

### Chaos Raid
Spawn as two teams CHAOS and NTF in a ratio of 1:1. CHAOS must steal all the items in the facility while NTF must stop them. The CHAOS can let SCPs and Class-D out. CHAOS receive reward items on successfully stealing items. CHAOS win if they steal all the items while NTF win if they survive all 7 spawn waves and kill all the CHAOS, SCPs and Class-Ds. If the Nuke goes off the winner is decided by who was in the lead stolen/protected.

### Dog Infection
[recommended player count 30+] Light is locked down and everyone spawns as ClassD in light with one dog. Dog can infect Class-Ds on kill, the last ClassD alive wins!

### Dogs In The Dark
All facility lights disabled. All SCPs will be SCP939. Everyone will spawn with a Flashlight.

### Elimination Tournament
Elimination style tournament. PvP fights contained inside a zone. Preround item/zone bans, loadout selection and 'Storm/force field' forces players to fight.
Tournament can be run in 3 different ways. Role, Predefined and Scrimmage.
 - ``Role`` the default, sets up bracket randomly based on the roles of joined players(all roles are included in the bracket) players without a role will not be assigned a team. used for serious well organized events.
 - ``Predefined`` use the ``predef`` command. sets up the the bracket based on the config, will use the players Role to assign teams. players that do not have a role that is defined in the predefined bracket will not be assigned a team. used for serious well organized events.
 - ``Scrimmage`` use the ``scim <team_count>`` command. sets up a bracket assigning players randomly to all the teams based on the ``team_count``. Roles wont be used to assign the team. good for quick casual unorganized events.

The idea behind ``Role`` and ``Predefined`` is that you can role sync with a different system e.g. ``CedMod``, ``config_remoteadmin.txt`` etc. to allow quick setup of organized matches.
Note. ``team_name`` is not the ``Badge Text``(what you see when you press N). ``team_name`` does not contain white space so it can be used for commands and does not have to be the same as the badge. e.g. Badge = ``My Team``, team_name = ``mt``. you defined the ``team_name`` and ``Badge Text`` when you set up the Roles i.e. ``CedMod``, ``config_remoteadmin.txt`` etc.

## Installation
Go to [releases](https://github.com/brayden-dowson/TheRiptide/releases) to download all the relevant .dlls

### Events
You must have [Cedmod](https://cedmod.nl/Servers/Setup) installed to run events. Once you have Installed [Cedmod](https://cedmod.nl/Servers/Setup) place the [[EventName]Event.dll](https://github.com/brayden-dowson/TheRiptide/releases) into the ``CedMod/CedmodEvents`` folder. Some Events have extra steps and dependencies refer to the [Event Details](https://github.com/brayden-dowson/TheRiptide#event-details) for any extra details for installation. Most Events use [EventUtility.dll](https://github.com/brayden-dowson/TheRiptide/releases), [Utility.dll](https://github.com/brayden-dowson/TheRiptide/releases), and [Teleport.dll](https://github.com/brayden-dowson/TheRiptide/releases) as dependencies so add them to be safe. The dependency folder is ``plugins/"server port" | "global"/dependencies``. Additionally [FacilityManager.dll](https://github.com/brayden-dowson/TheRiptide/releases) should be installed in the plugins folder not the dependency folder.
### Plugins
Plugins must be installed manually. Place the [[PluginName].dll](https://github.com/brayden-dowson/TheRiptide/releases) in your servers ``plugins/"server port" | "global"`` folder. To be safe add [Utility.dll](https://github.com/brayden-dowson/TheRiptide/releases) and [Teleport.dll](https://github.com/brayden-dowson/TheRiptide/releases) as dependencies. The dependency folder is ``plugins/"server port" | "global"/dependencies``. Additionally [FacilityManager.dll](https://github.com/brayden-dowson/TheRiptide/releases) should be installed in the plugins folder not the dependency folder.

### Dependencies
You must install all dependencies for the events/plugins to work. Install [EventUtility.dll](https://github.com/brayden-dowson/TheRiptide/releases), [Utility.dll](https://github.com/brayden-dowson/TheRiptide/releases), and [Teleport.dll](https://github.com/brayden-dowson/TheRiptide/releases) as dependencies. The dependency folder is ``plugins/"server port" | "global"/dependencies``. Additionally [FacilityManager.dll](https://github.com/brayden-dowson/TheRiptide/releases) should be installed in the plugins folder not the dependency folder. Some Events require additional plugins to work notably [SLOC Loader](https://github.com/Axwabo/slocLoader) and [Ultra Quaternion](https://github.com/brayden-dowson/UltraQuaternion), so make sure you have these installed if they are required otherwise the Events will not work. 

### Maps
A map is a special .dll for loading map objects/logic for the Traitor Among Us Event. There is only 1 map at the time of writing (The Riptide's Skeld) but more may be added in the future. There is an existing interface accessible from the [TraitorAmongUs.dll](https://github.com/brayden-dowson/TheRiptide/releases) ``IMap`` which developers can use to make their own maps for the event. Simply compile the .dll once you have implemented the ``IMap`` interface. To load a map add the [[MapName].dll](https://github.com/brayden-dowson/TheRiptide/releases) to the ``CedMod/CedmodEvents/Traitor Among Us Event/Maps`` folder. And in game use the ``tau_map <map_name>`` command to select the map.
